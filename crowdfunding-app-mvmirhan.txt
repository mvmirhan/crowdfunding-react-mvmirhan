Hi Lachie,

Thanks for all your patience while teaching us the Javascript and React.
I'm hoping that I'll get better as I keep using these new skill sets while working
on our final project for SheCodes.

Just a heads-up that the assignment I'll be uploading tonight still requires a lot of work.
I intend to update this prior the ShowCase.

Below are the links to my GitHub Repo and the deployed app.
